# Droame_task_3
In this I have solved the drone path problem(task3).
# Problem Statement:
In this problem we are given the starting,ending points ina 2-D plane and we have to find the paths within the given time without collision.
# Approach :
Tried to solve the problem with bruteforce method in this I have tried to find all possible paths with least possible time and tried to choose the possible path with the least time.
# Language used : 
I used C++ in this because of availability of OOPS and Standard Template Library(STL); 
# Complexity:
Since I have used the brute force approach to solve this problem where I will be choosing the best path out of all possible paths so its complexity is exponential.
